Decisions Design

​PostGIS Optimization: I implemented GIST indexing in schema.sql to guarantee sub-second latency for real-time geospatial queries.

​Data Integrity: Using Pydantic models in Python ensures high data quality before ingestion, a critical requirement for foundational data infrastructure.

​Scalability: The system is designed to handle millions of data points across multiple regions using JSONB for flexible schema management.
